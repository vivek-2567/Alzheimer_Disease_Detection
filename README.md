<p id="description">This end-to-end Alzheimer's disease detection machine learning project showcases the potential of using advanced neural networks to aid in early diagnosis. By leveraging non-invasive brain imaging data and cognitive assessments this model has the potential to become a valuable tool for healthcare professionals enabling timely intervention and improving the quality of life for patients and their families. This is trained on more than 2.6 Million different parameters and has a weighted average F1 Score of 0.97. The project is deployed at Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed by anyone.</p>
